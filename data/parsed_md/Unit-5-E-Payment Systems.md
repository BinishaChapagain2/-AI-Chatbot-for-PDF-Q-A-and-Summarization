# Introduction of E-Payment:

E-payment is a subset of an e-commerce transaction to include electronic payment for buying and selling goods or services offered through the Internet. Generally, we think of electronic payments as referring to online transactions on the internet, there are many forms of electronic payments.

As technology is developing, the range of devices and processes to transact electronically continues to increase while the percentage of cash and check transactions continues to decrease.

An e-commerce payment system facilitates the acceptance of electronic payment for online transactions. The main objectives of EPS are to increase efficiency, improve security, and enhance customer convenience and ease of use.

# Types of E-Payment:

- Payment Cards
- Electronic wallets
- Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)
- Electronic Check (E-check)
- Electronic Cash Systems
- Micro Payment Systems

# 1. Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT):

EFT involves electronic transfer of money by financial institutions. It is the electronic transfer of money from one bank account to another, either within a single financial institution or across multiple institutions, through computer-based systems and without the direct intervention of bank staff. One of the most widely used EFT programs is Direct Deposit, in which payroll is deposited straight into an employee's bank account.

EFT is the groundwork of the cash-less and check-less culture where paper bills, checks, envelopes, stamps are eliminated. The advantages of EFT contain the following:

1. Simplified Accounting
2. Improved Efficiency
3. Reduced Administrative Costs
4. Improved Security

# 2. Payment Cards:

A payment card is a device usually an embossed plastic card that allows its owner (the cardholder) to make an electronic payment. They contain stored financial values that can be transferred from the customer's computer to the businessman's computer. E.g. Credit cards, debit cards, charge cards, smart cards are payment cards.

# A. Credit Cards:

They are the most popular method used in EPSS and are used by charging against the customer credit. There are two types of credit cards on the market today:

1. Credit Cards Issued By Credit Card Companies (E.G., MasterCard, Visa Card) and Major Banks: Credit cards are issued based on the customer's income level, credit history, and total wealth. The customer uses these cards to buy goods and services or get cash from the participating financial institutions. The customer is supposed to pay his or her debts during the payment period; otherwise, interest will accumulate. Two limitations of credit cards are their unsuitability for very small or very large payments.

# b. Credit Cards Issued by Department Stores and Oil Companies:

Businesses extremely benefit from these company cards, and they are cheaper to operate. They are widely issued to and used by a broad range of customers. Businesses offer incentives to attract customers to open an account and get one of these cards.

# B. Debit Cards:

The difference between credit cards and debit cards is to pay with a debit card you need to know your personal identification number (PIN) and need a hardware device that can read the information that is stored in the magnetic stripe on the back. Debit cards task like checks in that the charges will be taken from the customer's checking account. The benefit for the customer is the easiness of use and convenience. These cards also keep the customer under his or her budget because they do not allow the customer to go beyond his or her resources.

# C. Charge Cards:

Charge cards are similar to credit cards except they have no revolving credit line, so the balance must be paid off every month. A credit card is different from a charge card: a charge card requires the balance to be paid in full each month. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged.

# D. Smart cards:

They include stored financial value and other important personal and financial information used for online payments. A smart card is about the size of a credit card, made of plastic with an embedded microprocessor chip that holds important financial and personal information. The money on the card is saved in an encrypted form and is protected by a password to ensure the security of the smart card solution. To pay via a smart card, it is necessary to introduce the card into a hardware terminal, which requires a special key from the issuing bank to start a money transfer in either direction. Smart cards can be disposable or rechargeable. A popular example of a disposable smart card is the one issued by telephone companies. Smart-card technology can be used to hold information on health care, transportation, identification, retail, loyalty programs and banking, to name a few. Smart cards are broadly classified into two groups:

- a. Contact: This type of smart card must be inserted into a special card reader to be read and updated.
- b. Contact-less: This type of smart card can be read from a short distance using radiofrequency.

A smart card is a plastic payment System card that contains data in an embedded microchip. The embedded chip can be a microprocessor combined with a memory chip or just a memory chip with nonprogrammable logic. Information on a microprocessor card can be added, deleted, or otherwise manipulated; a memory-chip card is usually a "read-only" card, like a magnetic stripe card. The card's programs and data must be downloaded from, and activated by, some other device (such as an ATM).

# 3. Electronic Money (E-Money/E-Cash):

This is standard money converted into an electronic format to pay for online purchases. Like regular cash, e-cash enables transactions between customers without the need for banks or other third parties. When used, e-cash is transferred directly and immediately to the participating merchants and vending machines. E-cash usually operates on a smart card, which includes an embedded microprocessor chip that stores cash value and the security features that make electronic transactions secure. Another form of electronic money is network money, software that allows the transfer of value on computer networks, particularly the internet. E-cash is transferred directly from the customer's desktop to the merchant's site, so e-cash transactions usually require no remote authorization or personal identification number (PIN) codes at the point of sale. A customer or merchant signs up with one of the participating banks or financial institutions. The customer receives specific software to install on his or her computer. The software allows the customer to download "electronic coins" to his or her desktop. The software manages the electronic coins. When the customer accepts the payment request after any purchase from the merchant, the software residing on the customer's desktop subtracts the payment amount from the balance and creates a payment that is sent to the bank or the financial institution of the merchant, and then is deposited to the merchant's account.

# 4. Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR:

MICR code is a character-recognition technology used mainly by the banking industry to ease the processing and clearance of cheques and other. In the MICR, data are printed at the bottom of cheques in magnetic ink that typically includes the document-type indicator, bank code, bank account number, cheque number, and a control indicator. The technology allows MICR readers to scan and read the information directly into a data- collection device. Unlike barcodes and similar technologies, MICR characters can be read easily by humans.

# 5. Electronic Cheque:

E-cheque is the result of cooperation among several banks, government entities, technology companies, and e-commerce organizations. An e-cheque uses the same legal and business protocols associated with traditional paper checks, here, it replaces the handwritten signatures with digital signature. It is a new payment instrument that combines high-security, speed, convenience, and processing efficiencies for online transactions.

# 6. Electronic Wallets (E-Wallets):

They are similar to smart cards as they include stored financial value for online payments. Electronic wallets (or Digital Wallets) being very useful for frequent online shoppers are commercially available for pocket, palm-sized, handheld, and desktop PCs. They offer a secure, convenient, and portable tool for online shopping. They can also store personal and financial information such as credit cards, passwords, PINS, e-checks, e-cash and much more. Consumers are not required to fill out order forms on each site when they purchase an item because the information has already been stored and is automatically updated and entered the order fields across merchant sites when using a digital wallet. Digital Wallets allow shoppers to link credit cards or other alternative payment methods to a virtual wallet. Their information is encrypted or protected by private software code. Example: eSewa, Khalti, IME-Pay, Nepal Pay etc.

# 7. Micro-Payment Systems:

Merchants must pay a fee for each credit card transaction that they process; this can become costly when customers purchase inexpensive items. Micro-payments are used for small payments on the Web. The process is like e-wallet technology where the customer transfers some money into the wallet on his or her desktop and then pays for digital products by using this wallet. IBM offers micro-payment wallets and servers. IBM micro-payment systems allow vendors and merchants to sell content, information, and services over the Web. It provides universal acceptance and offers comprehensive security. It can be used for billing by banks and financial institutions, ISPs, content providers (offering games, entertainment, archives, etc.), telecommunications, service providers (offering fax, e-mail, or phone services over the Web), and by premium search engines and specialized databases.

# The processing of credit card payments has two major phases: authorization and settlement.

There are several parties involved in both processes including:

- Customer: The individual possessing the card.
- The Merchant: The vendor that sells goods or services.
- Issuing bank: The issuer (usually a bank) of the credit or debit card to customer (or businesses). Services include billing and collecting monthly payments.
- Merchant acquiring Bank: Enrolls merchants into a program that accepts a specific card brand (e.g., Visa) and on the merchant's behalf, processes debit or credit card payments made using that particular card brand.
- Credit card (association) network: Credit card networks determine where credit cards can be used and facilitate the payment process between credit card users, merchants, and credit card issuers.
- Payment service provider: The company that provides electronic connections and transaction services among all the parties involved in electronic payments (including authorizations). A payment service provider is also called a payment gateway provider.

# How Credit Card Authorization Works?

Payment Gateway

| Your customer                | WWW                           |                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Merchant/vendor bank account | Merchant/vendor bank          |                                          |
| Credit card provider         | Credit card interchange (CCI) | Merchant/vendor bank's controller system |

# Authorization Cycle:

The customer initiates a payment transaction (fills out web page, swipes a card, etc.). The merchant receives the transaction information. This information is passed to its PSP where it is routed to the merchant’s acquiring bank (processor). The acquiring bank passes the information to the issuing bank through the credit card network. If the issuing bank approves the transaction, an authorization code is sent back to merchant via the same linkages. The issuing bank also holds an authorization associated with that merchant and consumer for the approved amount. Finally, the merchant notifies the customer and fulfills the order.

# Settlement:

At the end of the day, the merchant submits in batch all the approved authorizations they have received to the acquiring bank via its PSP. Again, the acquiring bank makes the batch settlement request to the issuing bank via the card network. The credit card issuer makes a settlement payment to the acquiring bank via the card network.

# E-checks and its processing in online

An electronic version or representation of a paper cheque. The account holder writes an e-check (or e-cheque) using a computer or other type of electronic device and transmits checks to the payee electronically. Like paper cheques, e-checks are signed by the payer and endorsed by the payee. Rather than handwritten or machine-stamped signatures, however e-checks are affixed with digital signatures, using combination of smart cards and digital certificates.

The payee deposits the e-check, receives credit, and the payee's bank clears the e-check to the paying bank. The paying bank validates the e-check and then charges the cheque writer's account for the cheque. Additionally, it has more security features than standard paper checks including authentication, public key cryptography, digital signatures, and encryption, among others.

| You want to collect                                                                          | an eCheck payment from a customer                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You receive authorization                                                                    | from your customer:                                                                |
| You bank post payment                                                                        | The processor receives the transaction date and forwards it to the customer's bank |
| The processor distributes the verified eCheck file to your bank                              |                                                                                    |
| The customer's bank and processor communicate to verify the submitted information is correct | Your customer's bank receives the transaction                                      |

#This process takes about days

#The funds are typically available the following day

# Automated clearinghouse (ACH)

In the United States, the ACH Network is the national automated clearing house for electronic funds transfers. It processes financial transactions for consumers, businesses, and federal, state, and local governments. ACH processes large volumes of credit and debit transactions in batches.

Nepal Clearing House Limited (NCHL), a subsidiary of the Central Bank of Nepal, has implemented an Electronic Check Clearing (ECC) system in Nepal. The introduction of ECC has drastically reduced the time required to clear the checks from a few days to minutes. Currently, 140 banks and financial institutions' 1200 branches across the country use our system. Checks are cleared at the branch level itself. Integrated Solutions partnered with Progress-Soft Corporation, Jordan, for the supply and implementation of ECC solution in Nepal.

Electronic Cheque Clearing (NCHL-ECC) is an image-based, cost-effective, MICR cheque processing and settlement solution where an original paper cheque is converted into an image for electronic processing of the financial transactions between participating member Banks/FIs. The physical movement of the cheques are truncated or stopped at the level of the presenting bank in the NCHL-ECC System. The cheque does not physically travel to the clearing house or to the paying branch as it used to do in the manual clearing process resulting in a faster and easier processing of the cheque transactions.

Mobile payments (Digital wallet)
Mobile wallets are a form of digital wallet most often used on mobile devices. One of the biggest advantages of digital wallets is that they let you pay for things without credit or debit cards, once you enter and store your card and banking information in the mobile payment platform. Usually, mobile payment refers to payment transactions initiated or confirmed using a person's mobile device, usually a smartphone although payments can be made with other mobile devices such as tablets and wearables. The term covers several different types of solutions, as well as different combinations of hardware and software technologies.

Mobile payment is a popular method for government's payments to people, especially in developing countries such as Nepal, India and Brazil, where more people have smartphones than bank accounts.

"Digital Wallet" also known as a "mobile wallet" or an "e-wallet" which is an online service or system that can store user's payment information. It can be used to make micro-electronic transactions. We can make such transactions via the internet, SMS, or a mobile app, after simple steps for registration. Example for international online payment platforms like Google Pay, Samsung Pay, Facebook Pay, etc. in context of Nepal eSewa, Khalti, IME Pay, PrabhuPay, QPay Nepal, Nepal Pay etc.

The term mobile digital wallet refers to the combination of an electronic account along with a smartphone and mobile app designed to make purchases digitally and to redeem rewards from loyalty programs and targeted digital promotions. There are two main types of wallets - device-based and cloud-based.

# Device-Based Digital Wallets

These are proximity payment systems enabled by near-field communication (NFC) technology. On the consumer side, the system requires that the mobile device being used is equipped with NFC antenna and an integrated chip or a smart card inside the phone that holds payment card information (credit or debit). On the merchant's side, it requires a specialized NFC reader used to recognize the chip when the chip comes within a short distance of the reader and a network for handling the payment.

Essentially, a buyer first enters his or her credit card information into the wallet app on the phone prior to shopping. At the time of the purchase, the buyer then "waves" the specially equipped mobile phone near a reader to initiate a payment. The reader collects the info and passes it to the payment network. The card is charged, and the purchase is complete.

These proximity payments are also called contactless payments where the phone plays the surrogate role of a contactless card with a chip. The most popular are PayPal wallet (paypal.com), Apple Pay (apple.com/apple-pay), and Android Pay (android.com/pay).

# Cloud-Based Digital Wallets

An alternative to device-based mobile wallets is cloud-based mobile wallets. The infrastructure for these wallets is not as onerous as a system based on NFC. Basically, a customer enrolls his or her card with a secure Web service. Requests for payments are made to the service and charged to enrolled card(s).

In this way no card information is transmitted during a purchase. Instead, transactions are initiated by scanning a barcode or Quick Response (QR) code created specifically for the customer and stored and displayed on the smartphone by wallet app. A QR code is a 2D barcode consisting of a collection of black square dots placed on a square grid with a white background.

What is required on the merchant's end is a barcode or QR code image reader that is networked into the service via the Web. The whole system operates much like the way PayPal operates without using a Web page with a PayPal button to start the process. Instead, it starts when the code is scanned. As a point of fact PayPal employs a cloud-based mobile wallet instead of device-based.

International payment system
International payments consist of outgoing and incoming payments in a country's currency out of and into that country, as well as offshore payments in that currency, between two parties outside that country. A global payment and settlement system exists for each national currency. For payments between distant parties over such a system to function like the face-to-face delivery of cash, a robust banking system, tight risk controls, and sophisticated technological and liquidity-saving features must be put in place.

# 1. Visa

Visa Inc. is an American multinational financial services corporation headquartered in Foster City, California, United States. It facilitates electronic funds transfers throughout the world, most commonly through Visa-branded credit cards, debit cards, and prepaid cards. Visa partners with companies across the world to facilitate transaction processing for both banks and merchants. Financial institutions and fintech companies can establish service agreements with Visa for branded cards that use the Visa network. Service agreements include bank transaction fees and Visa network charges. Visa also partners with merchants through varying types of service agreements.

Visa is one of the major global payment systems, facilitating electronic funds transfers and transactions between consumers, merchants, and financial institutions. Here’s a brief overview of how it works:

1. Card Issuance: Visa cards are issued by banks and financial institutions. These cards can be credit, debit, or prepaid cards.
2. Transaction Initiation: When you use a Visa card to make a purchase, you enter your card details at the point of sale, whether it's a physical store or an online retailer.
3. Authorization Request: The transaction information is sent from the merchant's point-of-sale system to the acquiring bank (the merchant's bank), which forwards it to Visa's network.
4. Verification: Visa's network routes the transaction request to the cardholder’s issuing bank (the bank that issued the Visa card). The issuing bank checks the card details, ensures there are sufficient funds or credit, and assesses fraud risk.
5. Authorization Response: The issuing bank sends an authorization response back to Visa's network, which forwards it to the acquiring bank, and then to the merchant’s point-of-sale system. If the transaction is approved, it’s completed; if not, it’s declined.
6. Settlement: After the transaction is authorized, the actual transfer of funds happens. The acquiring bank collects the payment from the issuing bank through Visa’s network and deposits it into the merchant’s account. The cardholder’s account is debited or charged accordingly.
7. Billing: The cardholder receives a statement or bill from their issuing bank detailing the transaction. They are responsible for repaying the amount spent if it's a credit card, or ensuring sufficient funds are available if it's a debit card.
8. Security Measures: Visa incorporates various security measures, such as encryption, fraud detection systems, and tokenization, to protect cardholders and merchants from fraudulent activities.

# Virtual Currency

Virtual currency is a type of digital currency that is typically unregulated and exists only in electronic form. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, virtual currencies are decentralized and often operate on blockchain technology, which provides security and transparency.

# Examples of Virtual Currencies:

- Bitcoin (BTC): The first and most well-known cryptocurrency, used as a digital store of value and a medium of exchange.
- Ethereum (ETH): A cryptocurrency that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).
- Ripple (XRP): A digital payment protocol and cryptocurrency designed for fast, low-cost international money transfers.
- Litecoin (LTC): A peer-to-peer cryptocurrency like Bitcoin but with faster transaction times and a different hashing algorithm.

# Advantages of Virtual Currency:

- Decentralization: Most virtual currencies, like Bitcoin, are decentralized, meaning they are not controlled by any government or central authority, reducing the risk of manipulation or interference.
- Lower Transaction Costs: Transactions involving virtual currencies often have lower fees compared to traditional banking or credit card transactions, especially for international transfers.
- Fast Transactions: Virtual currencies enable near-instantaneous transactions, which can be particularly beneficial for international payments.
- Financial Existence: Virtual currencies can provide access to financial services for people in regions without traditional banking infrastructure.
- Security and Transparency: Blockchain technology, which underpins many virtual currencies, offers high security and transparency due to its immutable and public ledger.
- Privacy: Some virtual currencies offer higher levels of privacy than traditional payment methods, allowing users to conduct transactions without revealing personal information.

# Disadvantages of Virtual Currency:

- Instability: The value of virtual currencies can be highly volatile, leading to significant price fluctuations, which can result in financial losses.
