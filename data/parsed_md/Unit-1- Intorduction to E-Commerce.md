# Commerce

Commerce is a division of trade or production which deals with the exchange of goods and services from producer to final consumer.

- It comprises the trading of economic values as goods, services, information or money between two or more entities.
- Commerce primarily expresses the abstract notions of buying and selling.

# E-commerce

Electronic commerce, in a broad sense, is the use of computer networks to improve organizational performance. Increasing profitability, gaining market share, improving customer service, and delivering products faster are some of the organizational performance gains possible with electronic commerce.

Electronic commerce is more than ordering goods from an on-line catalog. It involves all aspects of an organization’s electronic interactions with its stakeholders, the people who determine the future of the organization. Thus, electronic commerce includes activities such as establishing a Web page to support investor relations or communicating electronically with college students who are potential employees. In brief, electronic commerce involves the use of information technology to enhance communications and transactions with all an organization’s stakeholders.

# How E-Commerce works:

The working of e-commerce is like that of any offline or retail business. The main three functions in e-commerce are receiving orders, processing order information, and shipping. Let us look at the detailed understanding of the virtual process that takes place from computer surfing to dispatch. These steps are:

1. The business created an e-commerce website: You can use an e-commerce website builder to launch an online store, sometimes for free.
2. The business lists products and services: Once your website is live, you can add products in a variety of colors and sizes. The best online store builders let you list unlimited products. You may also be able to list products on social media websites like Instagram or third-party marketplaces like Amazon.
3. A customer chooses what they want to buy: Shoppers can browse your catalog and place items in their online shopping cart.
4. The customer uses a online payments to pay for it: You’ll need a payment processing service to facilitate these transactions, but one may come built into your e-commerce website.
5. The business receives the order: Most online store builders include a dashboard where you can see all the orders you’ve received and track their status.
6. The business ships the product or provides the service: Lastly, you’ll need to give the customer what they paid for. Again, some e-commerce website builders offer tools to help, including shipping label printing and package tracking.

- However, this situation is changing rapidly due to the widespread use of smartphones and tablet computers.
- In addition, now consumers are more accepting of the handheld culture.
- Furthermore, the adoption of m-commerce is accelerating due to the spread of 4G networks (and soon 5G). Finally, free Wi-Fi Internet access in many locations helps.

# M-Commerce: Attributes

- Specific attributes of M-commerce
- Mobility: Mobile computing and m-commerce are based on the fact that users carry a mobile device anywhere they go.

- Value-added attributes of M-commerce

- Convenience: Users can operate the wireless devices in any environment.
- Instant connectivity: Connections are available quickly and easily at anytime and anywhere.

# Location-based commerce (L-commerce)

L-commerce, short for location-commerce, is the act of using location-based services such as GPS tracking for business purposes, for example, to enhance the customer experience and maximize sales. It is referring to the use of location-finding systems such as GPS-enabled devices or similar technologies (e.g cell-based stations) to find where a customer with a mobile device or an object is located and provide relevant services, such as an advertisement or vehicle route optimization. LBC is also known as LBS (location-based systems).

- LBS is "a software application for an IP-capable mobile device that requires knowledge about where the mobile device is located.
- L-commerce offers convenient services to consumers such as connections with friends, the ability to receive relevant and timely sales information, safety features (e.g. emergency assistance), and convenience (a user can locate what facility needed is nearby without consulting a directory or a map).

➢ Sellers get the opportunity to advertise and provide or meet a customer's needs in real time. In essence, LBC is the delivery of m-commerce transactions to individuals who are in a known specific location, at a specific time.

➢ E-commerce applications provided to customers based on a user’s specific location

# Location-based technologies

- Global positioning systems (GPS): a wireless system that uses satellites to enable users to determine their position anywhere on the earth.
- Geographical information systems (GIS): relates longitude and latitude of GPS into place or address (mapinfo.com)
- Location Based Mobile System (LBMS): Real time location tracking feature of the smartphone.

# Basic Concepts in L-Commerce:

Location-based m-commerce mainly includes five possible activities, all done in real time:

1. Location: Finding where a person (with a smartphone) or another mobile device or a thing (e.g., a truck) is located.
2. Navigation: Finding and illustrating a route from one location to another (e.g., as is done in Google Maps).
3. Tracking: Monitoring the movements and whereabouts of people or objects (e.g., a truck, airplane).
4. Mapping: Creating maps of certain geographical locations with superimposed data if needed (e.g., GIS, Google Maps).
5. Timing: Determining the arrival or departure time of something at a specific location (e.g., arrival of a bus to a specific bus stop or an airplane to an airport).

➢ For example, WeatherBug (weather weatherbug.com) and Send Word Now (sendwordnow.com) have combined some of these five services to ensure the safety of customers, employees, and stores during severe weather and other emergencies.

➢ A recent development of L-commerce is known as real-time location systems (RTLS), which are used to track and identify the location of objects in real time.

# L-Commerce Infrastructure

L-commerce is based on an infrastructure. The components depend on the applications. However, the following conditions usually exist:
| 1. Location finder (positioning) component: | A GPS (or other device) that finds the location of a person or a thing.                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2. Mobile Positioning Center:               | This includes a server that manages the location information received from the location finder.                                                        |
| 3. User:                                    | The user can be a person or thing (e.g., a vehicle).                                                                                                   |
| 4. Mobile devices:                          | The user needs a mobile device (e.g., a smartphone) that includes a GPS or other feature that locates the location (position) of something or someone. |
| 5. Mobile communication networks:           | The network(s) that transfers user requests to the service providers and then transmits the reply to the user.                                         |
| 6. Service or application providers:        | Providers are responsible for servicing a user's request. They may use applications such as GIS.                                                       |

# Location-based services and Applications:

A location-based service (LBS) is a mobile device-based computerized service, which utilize information about the geographical position of a user’s mobile device (e.g. mobile phone tracking) for delivering a service (e.g. advertisers can target ads to specific location), to the user. There are many LBS applications. For a list of 12:

Location-based services (applications). Location based services can be used in marking, operations, services, finance, and so forth. LBS also works in asset tracking (e.g. of parcels at USPS or FedEx) and in vehicle tracking. LBS also includes location-based games.

Other examples of location-based services are:

1. Recommending public events in a city to tourists and residents
2. Asset recovery, for example, finding stolen cars
3. Pointing a user to the nearest business (e.g. a gas station) to his (her) location
4. Providing detailed navigation from any place to any address (sometimes with voice prompts)
5. Location things (such as trucks) and displaying them on the mobile device map
6. Inventory tracking warehouses
7. Delivering alerts, such as notification of a real time sale in a specific store.

# Barriers to Location Based M-Commerce

1. Lack of GPS in some mobile phones: Without GPS, it is difficult to use LBS. However, GPS-enabled phones are increasing in availability. In addition, the use of cell phone towers helps.
2. Accuracy of device: Some of the location finding tools are not too accurate. A good, but expensive, GPS provides accuracy of 10 ft. Less accurate locators provide accuracy of about 1500 ft.
3. The cost-benefit justification: The benefits of location-based services may not justify the cost. For customers, it may be inconvenient to utilize the service.
4. Limited network bandwidth: Wireless bandwidth is still limited. As bandwidth improves with 4G and 5G, applications will expand, which will increase the use of the technology.
5. Invasion of privacy: Many people are reluctant to disclose their whereabouts and have their movements tracked.
